# Contribution Guidelines 

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Fairshots and putting effort to making it better. There are a number of ways to do that:

1. File an issue with the project
2. Read the existing issues. (Maybe you can help fix one? Reading issues is also a good way to know what direction we are heading with the project. Likewise, filing issues allows all developers to discuss problems and confer about new directions for the project.)
3. Read or project Roadmap here [here](https://github.com/Fairshots/Fairshots.org/projects) and start collaborating


#### How to file a bug report

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Fairshots/Fairshots.org/issues).
If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug/issue?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### How to suggest a new feature

First collect positive feedback about the change. 
Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

#### How to set up your environment and run tests

1. Fork and clone this repository. 
P.s. If you become a insider collaborator you could also clone and create a new branch. 

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install 
```
or 
```bash
yarn install 
```

3. run scripts defined in package.json (i.e. npm or yarn start , npm or yarn test) 

4. BACKEND is autowired in a development server. So don't need to worry about installing DB or backend for development/tests. 
Backend code can be found in [https://github.com/Fairshots/backend](https://github.com/Fairshots/backend)
