## WHY PHOTOGRAPHY

We believe photography is a very powerful art form, and it has the power to change deeply encrusted paradigms and beliefs in society as a whole. Yet many times when you choose to work with photography we end up having to work with things that are not so inline with our most important values just to be able to survive. In fact plenty of times the type of work done by professional photographers might even be propagating the stereotypes that go against those same values. We understand the value of photography and we want to shift it towards more socially responsible themes.
