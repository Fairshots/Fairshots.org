                2. The Service
                <br />
                Fairshots provides an online platform where:
                <br />
                (a) non profit organizations can connect to photographer by creating Job
                opportunities.
                <br />
                (b) photographers can connect to non profit organizations by browsing those job
                opportunities and finding a match that suits them.
                <br />
                (c) both photographers and organizations can contact each other while accessing
                profile pages.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fairshots provides a service of connecting these two entities and we are not
                responsible for guaranteeing that the work will happen under the conditions
                advertised. Although we will take great measure to ensure our users follow the
                descriptions provided on job opportunities, it is the responsibility of the
                organizations and photographer to ensure continuation of projects once initial
                connection has been established by Fairshots.
                <br />
                <br />
                Organizations are under no obligation of hiring a photographer if they see
                applicants as unsuitable.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fairshots does not hold the rights of any image produced as a consequence of the
                connections created on the website. We recommend that organizations and
                photographers discuss the image usage rights before starting any work, taking in
                consideration the laws of each country.
                <br />
                <br />
                This website tries to ensure all registered photographers and organizations are
                legitimate and provide high quality work, but we do not endorse any specific user,
                and we are not responsible if the work performed by our users is not satisfactory.
